# angular-demo 

This is my demo angular project.

This single page application contains two pages (Fruit repository and Statistics).

I have put most of efforts on structioring the project with best angular programming practice.

You can run this project simply using any server.

I used simplehttpserver (https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplehttpserver)

Install using npm

  npm install simplehttpserver -g

Usage

Run simplehttpserver by command

 http://localhost:8000   .........Gooo!
